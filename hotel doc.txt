  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p> At greatcontent, we work with a range of food-related businesses, including some of Europe’s most dynamic delivery services. And we’ve found that success is about more than offering accessible apps, wide choice, and easy-to-navigate menus.To achieve the kind of visibility required to attract diners, online food ordering companies also need a comprehensive content strategy – one which markets their partner restaurants and their specialities, while foregrounding the delivery brand, and with dynamic SEO content to top it all off.</p>
